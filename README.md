## :pushpin: About the Chalenge
You are an entrepreneur, very attentive to market trends and have noticed the growing
water parks. There is plenty of software available to assist business owners or groups in
managing your business, but most are too expensive and have limitations. So you decided
create a company, with new ideas and better proposals, Ocean Solutions. After much thought, debate and listening
its consultants, it was decided to develop a new system, called Atlantis, a tribute to the city of Atlantis.
Atlantis' first proposal is that it be a generalist system, to manage water parks, clubs and hotels. Therefore,
It was decided to create a first module for it, one that would be used to register clients and their dependents. As every dependent has a
responsible, the dependent's address and telephone data must be the same as the responsible person's data.

## :pushpin: About the Chalenge
The new version, delivered by the development team, remains a CLI-type system,
just like the previous version. In this system there is no communication with any DBMS, therefore,
a class was used to store information while the system runs, such as
an in-memory database. This class was called “Warehouse”. This class
implements the Singleton pattern, so it has the private constructor method. The decision to
using Singleton came from one of its software engineers and, for now, it will be the main
way of storing data in the system during its execution.
The system has started to “take shape” and is very close to its first stable version,
ready to be presented to future customers and put into production. However, not yet
good enough for an MVP. According to the initial idea, when you thought of
founding the company, some features are mandatory and have not yet been implemented.
The objective now is to implement the mandatory features for the first MVP, maintaining
the application of already used standards and, if necessary, including new standards that you
consider important for the system. You are responsible for this part and for preparing the
system for its first launch.
