## :pushpin: About the Chalenge
You are an entrepreneur, very attentive to market trends and have noticed the growing
water parks. There is plenty of software available to assist business owners or groups in
managing your business, but most are too expensive and have limitations. So you decided
create a company, with new ideas and better proposals, Ocean Solutions. After much thought, debate and listening
its consultants, it was decided to develop a new system, called Atlantis, a tribute to the city of Atlantis.
Atlantis' first proposal is that it be a generalist system, to manage water parks, clubs and hotels. Therefore,
It was decided to create a first module for it, one that would be used to register clients and their dependents. As every dependent has a
responsible, the dependent's address and telephone data must be the same as the responsible person's data.
